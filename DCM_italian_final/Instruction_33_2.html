<h1> Phase 3 </h1>

<p>
 In overall:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>There is  a <b> {{prob_NOT_replace}}% probability </b> that your <b> earnings are determined by your own predictions</b>  in the binding choice situation and binding alternative (as determined in Phase 1 and 2) </li>

    <li>There is a <b> {{prob_replace}}% probability</b>  that <b>  your earnings</b>  are <b>determined by the predictions of people who choose the same alternative as you </b> in the binding choice situation  of the preference task </li>
</ul>

<p>
For example, if you choose option {{Constants.random_practice_alternative}}  in the binding choice situation, there is {{prob_replace}}% chance that your predictions will be replaced by the participants who chose option {{Constants.random_practice_alternative}}  in the binding choice situation  (just as you)
